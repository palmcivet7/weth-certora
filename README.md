# WETH Certora

This repo is to practice using Certora by verifying the WETH contract, and was inspired by [Horsefacts' weth invariant testing article/repo](https://github.com/horsefacts/weth-invariant-testing), and [Certora's Tutorials](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/tutorials.html).
